## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your repository
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   Add all variables from your `.env` file to Vercel's environment settings.

4. **Update Service URLs**
   - Add your Vercel URL to Appwrite's allowed origins
   - Update Plaid redirect URI with your Vercel URL
   - Update Dwolla allowed origins if needed

### Other Platforms
The application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Railway
- Render

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Bank credentials are never stored - handled by Plaid
- Dwolla provides secure payment processing
- HTTPS is enforced in production
- Session tokens are HTTP-only cookies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "ADDITIONAL_CONSENT_REQUIRED" error from Plaid
- **Solution:** Re-link your bank account and ensure transactions scope is granted

**Issue:** Dwolla funding source creation fails
- **Solution:** Verify your Dwolla credentials and ensure the bank account type is supported

**Issue:** Transactions not appearing after transfer
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Issue:** "No session" error
- **Solution:** Log out and log back in to refresh your session
